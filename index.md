## Welcome to Oxford Child-Centred AI

### About Oxford CCAI

On this page, you will find a series of research activities related to designing better AI for children, which is part of [Human Centred Computing](http://hcc.cs.ox.ac.uk) at the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk) in the University of Oxford.


Currently **OxfordCCAI** focuses on four main research and development themes:
- identifying age-appropriate AI algorithmic design patterns
- identifying age-appropriate ways to increase algorithmic transparecy for children
- identifying ways to support developer to build age-appropriate AI applications
- creating new paradigm of digital parenting in the AI of age

### News

Currently, we are actively recruiting families and children to join in our latest research study about children's data on YouTube. Join us to find out more! Please contact oxfordccai@cs.ox.ac.uk for more information.

### New paradigm of digital parenting in the AI of age

Are your parents always worried that you are spending too much time online or in front of screens? Do you and your parents always have to discuss how much time and when you are allowed to go online? And do some of them even use a parental control app or tool to control when you can go online and what you can do?


**KOALA Hero** allows parents and children to be more aware of the different third-party trackers that might be associated with the mobile apps that children are interacting with on their devices.

_Third-party trackers_ are widely observed on mobile apps, to carry out hidden data collection about user behaviour ('tracking'). This tracking behaviour is currently difficult to stop because there aren't many user-friendly apps or tools that users can use to detect and disable them, and also because there is a wide user awareness about the existing _tracking_ on their devices and their impact on their life. Furthermore, tracking is difficult to ban by the current data regulation enforcement because the purpose of the data collection and with whom this data may be shared with is still hard to trace.

The goals of **KOALA Hero** are three fold:
- revealing the companies behind tracking and exposing the purposes of tracking, such as analytics or advertising，to increase family users' awareness about tracking
- enabling families and children to block tracking selectively; and
- collecting further user evidence to advocate more stringent policies against tracking on children's digital devices.

The development of KOALA Hero is informed by several different science research by the Oxford HCC researchers, including:
- an extensive tracker list developed from analysing ~2 000 000 apps;
- an extensive survey of current parental control support on the app market
- several years of empirical research about children's current awareness about tracking risks and their parents' approach for safeguarding them


While the project is under development, we are actively producing information in various formats to increase public awareness about _tracking_, some of which will also be made available in the KOALA Hero app upcoming.

This work is supported by Oxford University's Impact Accelerate Grant [KOALA;EP/R511742/1](https://koala.web.ox.ac.uk) and COVID Rebuild Grant.
